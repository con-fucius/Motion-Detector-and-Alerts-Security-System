# SMART-SECURITY-SYSTEM
An automated way of improving the security inside your home

## Project Statement
The system is feasible in that it can alert you of any kind of movement or unauthorised access within your home even when you are miles away. This is basically by linking your security system to a telegram bot which incase of detected motion or forceful access in your home, the sensor will send a HIGH signal to the ESP 8266 board which will then relay this information to your telegram account via WiFi.
